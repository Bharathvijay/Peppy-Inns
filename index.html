                                <p><strong>Venue :</strong> Scope sports Academy, Kovalam</p>
                                <p><strong>Oppnonents :</strong> Rising stars</p>
                                <p><strong>Match result :</strong> <span id="color-trans-lose">Lost</span> by 5 Wickets</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>We had to travel almost 45 kms to play our first match of the tournament against Rising stars which was held in Scope sports Academy Kovalam, thanks to all the team members for not complaining about the distance and yet reaching the ground on time, we won the toss (which is little unusual) and elected to bat first in a windy conditions. Sishi and Ash opened innings for us; Ash was able to get some neat and clean strokes from his willow to fetch few boundaries for us and on the other side to our unfortunate, sishi doesn’t get his timing right which put a halt in brisk scoring. We lost both of them with less than 20 on the board; Ravi was not at his best as yet to recover completely from the surgery but able to hang out for some time and give company to sathish who was able to score couple of boundaries with some powerful strokes and against a run of play we lost two batsmen in a short span which kept us little perturbing for having lost 4 wickets less than 60 runs. Then came the  man of the day, Saravana who was at his usual flow kept scoring boundaries all over the park and well supported by vishag who was good in rotating the strike and hitting the occasional boundaries, after being set in the middle yet again Vishag gifted his wicket to the loopy spinner, even sundar doesn’t last after his first ball after giving a simple catch practice to the fielder at extra cover. We were trailing at 87/6 at one stage, given the conditions and our batting collapse we thought anything over 140 considered to be good score to defend, but to our surprise the duo of sara and Sathyan were scoring runs all over the park with some undefined sensible strokes, high credit must be given to both of them for scoring runs freely despite of unfamiliar strong breeze (rather we call it as desert storm). These two completed innings with an unbeaten 83 runs partnership for 7th wicket which put us in commendable position of 170 after the first innings (game revised to 28 overs). Saravana and Sathyan unbeaten with scores 54 and 37 respectively.</p> <br />
                                <p>We opened our bowling with yuvi and to our surprise the batsman went after him from the first delivery for a boundary and followed one more in the same over, due to a strong wind from the direction of south west to north east which made impossible to operate any medium pace bowlers from that end, having said its worth to mention the Ashok (dada) bowling his entire quota in one spell to prevent the medium pace bowlers bowling against the wind. At the half way stage Rising stars scored 96 /2 in 15 overs, we had to defend 74 in next 13 overs ,the bowling partnership of sishi and mahe made us to think about the positive result from the way of their precise line and length bowling, and the required rate was went onto need 52 runs in 8 overs, ravi bowled 21st over and get a crucial wicket and conceded 9 runs, which left Rising stars to get 43 in 7 overs, mahe took one more wicket in next over which showed immense turn over in the game (worth to mention the catch took by vishag against the strong wind). But the nature doesn’t leave the game to us in fruitful manner, all of a sudden the intensity of wind has increased which made us difficult even to run and sight the ball. It’s worth to mention, opponents took the advantage of the situation and kept scoring runs freely, example of this to mention about the six scored in 24th over, the batsman didn’t even bothered to hit it with full force as the wind was ready enough to take even the half hit strokes way over the boundary.  Having said about the misfortunes about the weather, it would be crime if we don’t mention the innings played by opening batsman of Rising stars, considering the difficult conditions he was able to stay till the end and helped his team to win the match. We lost the match in 27th over. This is one of the few games we lost after not making many errors in the field, we have 5 matches left in the league, and we should win at least 4 of them to qualify for semifinals without waiting for other match results as we were doing in previous tournaments.</p><br />

                                <p>After losing first match in the tournament we regrouped yet again on sat day, even before the start of play we were on a back foot for not having 5 of our regular players in the team due to various reasons and we found replacements at last minute and were all set to play the close-fitting game. We won the toss (consecutively second time) in the hot and humid conditions and with no hesitation we opted to bat first, we had Vijay and thareeq to open the innings for us. As we all know their talent and brilliance in their batting we just expected a bolstering start but to our disappointment we lost one of the openers (Vijay) in the very first ball of the innings, the ball was angling sharply into the stumps and cleaned him up. After the fall of first wicker Ravi went on to join thareeq in the middle, these two played attacking game as well as very sensible in their shot selection, almost scoring 9 runs per over consistently, thareeq took initial charge of scoring runs in boundaries all over the ground and he was well supported by Ravi.These two went on to put century partnership for 2nd wicket (only the second time in the history of peppy inns). Thareeq completed his half century in a grand style by clipping the ball of his pads to the boundary and soon he went on to play the aggressive shot by stepping down unfortunately he caught short of crease, Sridhar came in at no.4 . After being set in the middle Ravi was trapped LBW after well made 42 runs (off 38 balls)..We were 105/3, Saravana walked into middle after his stupendous knock in last match, but to our bitter shocking he dismissed caught behind without opening his account. Debutant Nandha (wicket keeper) joined Sridhar in the middle, Sridhar took charge immediately by scoring quick boundaries and these put us back on track but our hopes didn’t last long as sridhar caught out in the point, Sundar joined nanda and these two were sensible in taking ones and two’s and put on 25 runs partnership for 6th wicket but against run of play we lost three quick wickets nanda ran himself out, sundar and banny trapped LBW by attempting sweep shots, Mahe walked in at no.9 and played some good-looking shots (boundary over point is pick of the lot) and he was well supported by Balaji these two sensibly batted the overs and put us in comfortable position of 183/9 in 26 overs.
</p> <br />
                                <p>Defending 183 in 26 overs could be easily put us in the complacent mode but we consciously avoided to be in relaxed mood, Yuvi and sishi opened our bowling and these two seems to be immortal for our opponents and they rightly trap the opponents top order, Banny comes in for a first change and bowled tight line which made the batsman to go for erroneous shots, in no time opponents reduced 40/4 at the end of power play overs. Batsmen were just waiting for lose overs to score runs but they didn’t provided any opportunity to do so, Mahe as usual bowled a precise line and length bowling and he was equally well supported by debutant Balaji with his military medium pace bowling.  It’s worth to mention Nanda’s wicket keeping skills, he was stood like a little dynamo behind the stumps and doesn’t allow batsman to take even slightest of chance to come out of the crease. It’s unfair if this summary doesn’t talk about the magnitude of high quality fielding in the toughest conditions, throughout the innings we have not witnessed any sloppy fielding, dropping catches and adding to that it must be lauded for the efforts we put in to field with 9 fielders at one point of the game. Yuvi came back for his second spell and brought curtains on the opponents by taking 4 wickets in his last 2 overs which had on a hat-trick twice and ends up his maiden 5 wicket haul for peppy inns cc and rightly adjudged Man of the Match. We won the game comfortably with 45 runs margin and it made a huge come back in the tournament after losing first match.</p><br />

                                <p>In late 2013 we decided to compete with big boys of the city club tournaments hence we have enrolled for the CSCA champion’s trophy which has 32 teams overall for the contention of one trophy, out of which most of the other teams have already stamped their presence in club matches and we considered as new comers obviously there were not much attention on us either, in fact that was proven to be a point for us to show what we can capable of. The tournament was structured as 8 teams per group and top two will go onto play knock outs from there on, we showed tremendous display throughout the league phase by winning 5 out of 7 games, later we marched into finals by winning both QF and SF games at ease. We were assembled and thrilled to play our first ever cricket ball tournament finals in SRF ground, Manali, we won the toss and batted first, we scored 198 in 30 overs that considered to be mammoth total in grand finale and we never shown any empathy towards our opponents in the game and truly speaking they were not even looked as a chance to come back in the remaining part of the game, we knocked them in the finals by 94 runs and went on to win our first ever cricket ball trophy and even drenched it with our loveable kisses onto that.</p>

                                <p>After the initial burst in the CSCA league, we wanted to go one step further up by competing TNCA division teams who are participating in the tournament called SSCA league, which featured various teams who were playing in the present TNCA league tournaments, the tournament was structured as 7 teams in one group and top two teams qualify for grand finale, it was the tournament look alike every match played against the best team in the tournament. We won 5 out of 6 games and lost a game against Friends XI, after the league format we have secured second place in the group which let us to play in the finals against mighty Friends XI. We lost the crucial toss in the finals and we asked to bowl first, we have rattled the big boys within the modest score of 129 in 30 overs and we felt the game was nicely set up to us and surprisingly none of our batsmen were able to prove their batting strength due to the pressure of chasing in immense finals and we bundled out for 47 which made us to end the tournament with runners title.</p>
